Introduction
============
This repository stores a [Packer](https://www.packer.io) definitions of openSUSE Leap 42.1 for running [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).
 
The openSUSE Leap 42.1 box can be used to create a VirtualBox instance with Vagrant to install [SAP NW AS ABAP 750 SP02 Developer Edition](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/11/03/sap-nw-as-abap-750-sp02-developer-edition-to-download/?preview_id=391853) .
 
 All recommended system preparations will be done by packer and vagrant, as described at [Installing ABAP AS on Oracle VirtualBox](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/11/03/linux-for-newbies-installing-opensuse-on-oracle-virtualbox/?preview_id=391946) without the proxy part (step 11.).

 The steps 20. and 21. **sudo -i*** and ***FINALLY, we run the installation, by entering the command ./install.sh*** must be done manually!
