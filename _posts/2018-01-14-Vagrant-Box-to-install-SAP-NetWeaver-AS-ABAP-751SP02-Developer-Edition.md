Introduction
============
This repository stores a [Packer](https://www.packer.io) definitions of openSUSE Leap 42.3 for running [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).
 
The openSUSE Leap 42.3 box can be used to create a VirtualBox instance with Vagrant to install [SAP NW AS ABAP 751 SP02 Developer Edition](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/09/04/sap-as-abap-751-sp02-developer-edition-to-download/) .
 
 All recommended system preparations will be done by packer and vagrant, as described at [Installing ABAP AS on Oracle VirtualBox](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/09/04/newbies-guide-installing-abap-as-751-sp02-on-linux/) without the proxy part (step C.3.).

 The step D.1. ***sudo -i*** and ***FINALLY, we run the installation, by entering the command ./install.sh*** must be done manually!
